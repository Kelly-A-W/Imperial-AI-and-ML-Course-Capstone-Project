# Datasheet for BBO Capstone Project

## Motivation: 

The goal of this data set is to use it to find new query points and hopefully find the location of the maximum of the target variable for 8 different functions. This data allows me to conduct a BBO task using data from 8 different functions. 

## Composition: 

We were given the following information about the inputs and outputs in our project:
| Function   | Input     | Output    | Optimisation Goal | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Function 1** | 2D array | 1D array | Maximise | Detect likely contamination sources in a two-dimensional area, such as a radiation field, where only proximity yields a non-zero reading. The system uses Bayesian optimisation to tune detection parameters and reliably identify both strong and weak sources. |
| **Function 2** | 2D array | 1D array | Maximise | Imagine a black box, or a mystery ML model, that takes two numbers as input and returns a log-likelihood score. Your goal is to maximise that score, but each output is noisy, and depending on where you start, you might get stuck in a local optimum. To tackle this, you use Bayesian optimisation, which selects the next inputs based on what it has learned so far. It balances exploration with exploitation, making it well suited to noisy outputs and complex functions with many local peaks. |
| **Function 3** | 3D array | 1D array | Maximise | You’re working on a drug discovery project, testing combinations of three compounds to create a new medicine. Each experiment is stored in `initial_inputs.npy` as a 3D array, where each row lists the amounts of the three compounds used. After each experiment, you record the number of adverse reactions, stored in `initial_outputs.npy` as a 1D array. Your goal is to minimise side effects; in this competition, it is framed as maximisation by optimising a transformed output (e.g. the negative of side effects). |
| **Function 4** | 4D | 1D | Maximise | Address the challenge of optimally placing products across warehouses for a business with high online sales, where accurate calculations are costly and only feasible biweekly. To speed up decision-making, an ML model approximates these results within hours. The model has four hyperparameters to tune, and its output reflects the difference from the expensive baseline. Because the system is dynamic and full of local optima, it requires careful tuning and robust validation to find reliable, near-optimal solutions. |
| **Function 5** | 4D array | 1D array | Maximise | You’re tasked with optimising a four-variable black-box function that represents the yield of a chemical process in a factory. The function is typically unimodal, with a single peak where yield is maximised. Your goal is to find the optimal combination of chemical inputs that delivers the highest possible yield, using systematic exploration and optimisation methods. |
| **Function 6** | 5D | 1D | Maximise | You’re optimising a cake recipe using a black-box function with five ingredient inputs (e.g., flour, sugar, eggs, butter, milk). Each recipe is evaluated with a combined score based on flavour, consistency, calories, waste, and cost, where each factor contributes negative points as judged by an expert taster. This means the total score is negative by design. To frame this as a maximisation problem, your goal is to bring that score as close to zero as possible or, equivalently, to maximise the negative of the total sum. |
| **Function 7** | 6D | 1D | Maximise | You’re tasked with optimising an ML model by tuning six hyperparameters, for example learning rate, regularisation strength, or number of hidden layers. The function you’re maximising is the model’s performance score (such as accuracy or F1), but since the relationship between inputs and output isn’t known, it’s treated as a black-box function. Because this is a commonly used model, you might benefit from researching best practices or literature to guide your initial search space. Your goal is to find the combination of hyperparameters that yields the highest possible performance. |
| **Function 8** | 8D | 1D | Maximise | You’re optimising an eight-dimensional black-box function, where each of the eight input parameters affects the output, but the internal mechanics are unknown. Your objective is to find the parameter combination that maximises the function’s output, such as performance, efficiency, or validation accuracy. Because the function is high-dimensional and likely complex, global optimisation is hard, so identifying strong local maxima is often a practical strategy. For example, imagine you’re tuning an ML model with eight hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, number of layers, dropout rate, regularisation strength, activation function (numerically encoded), optimiser type (encoded), and initial weight range. Each input set returns a single validation accuracy score between 0 and 1. Your goal is to maximise this score. |


## Collection process: 

Each week, one query point is generated per function using bayesian optimisation. I fit a guassian process surrogate model to the available data, and then selected the next query point using an UCB acquistion function, allowing me to balance exploration and exploitation. The next week, I would be provided with the value of each function at the submitted query point. I then use these new data points to update my data set, refit my surrogate model, and choose a new querry point. This is repeated every week over 10 weeks. 


## Preprocessing and uses: 

I have applied power transformations to the data sets for functions 1, 3, 5 and 7 because the target variables were very skew, and fitting a Guassian process surrogate model requires a symmetric target variable. For all functions, the data was normalised before fitting the surrogate model to ensure that no variables with larger scales dominanted the model. 

## Distribution and maintenance: 
I have stored the data in separate folders for each week in the `updated_data` folder. Each week only contains the data I had available to me during that week, making it easier to reproduce my analysis in future. The data will continue to updated weekly as the project progresses. Data can be used at the users discretion. I (Kelly) am the maintainer of all data in this repo.
